# FixForm

A project for fun.

Many people want to work out or get better at sports. But finding the time or money for a personal trainer or a coach is not always easy. Our program works to adjust your posture and positioning in real time for almost any workout or sport based on a video upload. We aim to make the benefits of having personal trainers accessible to everyone!
If you want to work out like Arnold Schwarzenegger then all you need to do is upload a video of him doing your favorite exercise, then perform it yourself through our app and viola! You’ll instantly see how close your form is to his. The same applies for sports. Want to serve like Roger Federer? Upload a video of him serving, then practice your serving in front of our app until you serve like a champion!

## Design

Our app is meant to be simple and able to be used by a variety of people. Anyone who wants to imitate a professional athlete or weightlifter would be able to derive some use from the program. We hope to help people by ensuring that they are moving their bodies in a way that provides the least negative impact on them while they train or play sports. The right technique over many years can mean the difference between a sore body with knee/elbow braces and a healthy, pain-free body.

Our program designed with a two-part interface that clearly defines the section for ‘Trainers’ (upload video that you’re trying to imitate) from the section for ‘Learners’ (record yourself imitating the video).

## How it works!

Our program is separated into two main portions. We have the Trainer's side and the Learner's side. The Trainers side is where either the user can upload a video of the 'proper' way of performing an exercise. Once the video is analyzed, the user can move into the Learner's side and attempt to imitate the action in the video in front of their camera. Our program will then analyze the user's movements and compare them to that of the "Trainer's" and provide feedback in real time about how similar the forms are. 

## Our Story

Our team was inspired to come together by a love of sports and going to the gym. Some of us have gotten injured from performing various exercises and it would prevent us from going to the gym again until we healed. And even after we healed, the effects of the injury were still there. Because of our lack of experience with different exercises, this kind of thing would happen often. We realized many people were in a similar situation: they wanted to be healthy and fit, but a lack of experience would constantly hinder progress and discourage people from performing more complicated exercises.  
The worst instance of this happening was when one of our teammates got a hernia from performing a deadlift incorrectly and had to get surgery to fix it. We were all tired of these events occurring but naturally, as college students, we couldn’t afford a personal trainer to help correct our mistakes and teach us the right way to perform the exercises we were interested in. The idea behind FixForm rose from the ashes of our frustration and we realized this Hackathon was the best way to begin to turn our dreams into reality. 

## The Team - Posture Bois
